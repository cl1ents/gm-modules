# gm-modules <small>(not to be confused with Good Morning Modules:tm:)</small>

I honestly doubt I'll maintain anything here or even continue making/porting plugins for [goosemod](https://goosemod.com)<br>
but all I have to say is that [goosemod](https://goosemod.com) has to be the best discord mod, both as a dev and as a user

long live [goosemod](https://goosemod.com) !!! and [topaz](https://topaz.goosemod.com) !!!!!
